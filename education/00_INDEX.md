An automated honeypot system that detects threats using machine learning and responds automatically.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-protocol support (SSH, HTTP, SSDP)
- ML-based threat detection
- Automated response system
- Real-time monitoring
- Mobile dashboard

### **Threat Detection**
Process of identifying malicious activity through pattern recognition and behavioral analysis.

**Methods**:
- Signature-based detection
- Anomaly detection
- Machine learning models
- Behavioral analysis

### **Incident Response**
Steps taken when a threat is detected to contain and remediate the attack.

**Process**:
1. Detection
2. Analysis
3. Containment
